			Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?<br>
Incidental 31: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a, uh... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Oh, maybe... [Squidward takes out the pencil and the paper again] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away again] Hmmm... I'll have... [Squidward takes out the pencil and the paper again] ...no. Or maybe...<br>
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?<br>
Incidental 31: I'll have a... Krabby Patty.<br>
Squidward: [writing down the order] How original.<br>
Incidental 31: And with extra onions.<br>
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes the order and shows it to SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes the piece of paper and puts it with the rest of the orders]<br>
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! [cracks his knuckles, then adds each ingredient as mentioned] First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [he rings the bell]<br>
Squidward: Whatever. [Incidental 5 comes up and tells him what he wants and Squidward relays the order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]<br>
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. [at normal speed] One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]<br>
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to Incidental 5] It's been a thrill serving you.<br>
Incidental 5: Can I get some extra salt?<br>
Squidward: We're all out.<br>
Incidental 5: Could you check?<br>
Squidward: No. [Incidental 5 glares at him as he leaves. A giant chubby olive-green fish walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?<br>
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]<br>
Squidward: We serve food here, sir.<br>
SpongeBob: [with the order done] I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass!<br>
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants! [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.<br>
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.<br>
Bubble Bass: Yep.<br>
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?<br>
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty. The crowd gasps]<br>
SpongeBob: No!<br>
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]<br>
SpongeBob: [checks the patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [the customers are disappointed. SpongeBob tears the patty apart, searching for the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, and throws Squidward out of the way again]<br>
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.<br>
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!<br>
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money back guarantee']<br>
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]<br>
Bubble Bass: No.<br>
Mr. Krabs: [pulls the money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes the money]<br>
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.<br>
Mr. Krabs: How's about a [Bubble Bass starts walking away but Mr. Krabs holds onto his dollar] free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! [sobs] Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]<br>
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.<br>
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]<br>
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws him into the kitchen]<br>
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!<br>
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.<br>
SpongeBob: [pants] Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then... pickles? No, that's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the... pickles? No. [tries again] Mustard down, bun soft down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! D'oh, think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun, no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.<br>
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?<br>
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?<br>
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!<br>
Squidward: Huh? What? [SpongeBob walks out and tries to leave]<br>
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices the door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens the door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better get on home and rest my brain. [walks out, but walks back in] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs, and closes the door.]<br>
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is trying to write down the formula.]<br>
SpongeBob: No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomato, pickle, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No shoe. [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight.<br>
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob's bedroom that night.]<br>
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then... SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.<br>
Gary: Meow.<br>
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.<br>
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Nah! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning and the rooster crows where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is on the floor under his bed] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!<br>
Gary: Meow.<br>
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm with dolphin noise where it is still going off with a squeak.]<br>
[Bubble transition back to the Krusty Krab, where there is black smoke coming from the kitchen. Squidward wearing a cooking apron coughs loudly, and clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher.]<br>
Squidward: Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]<br>
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]<br>
Incidental 30: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty. [his patty is burnt]<br>
Incidental 63: He burnt my fries! [the burnt fries are piled up]<br>
Incidental 65: [briefly drinks his burnt shake] He burnt my shake.<br>
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]<br>
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! [sobs] No! No! Arrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!<br>
[Bubble transition back to SpongeBob's house. A toaster is on the front door.]<br>
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?<br>
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite.]<br>
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [he walks into view backwards and is wearing a pair of underwear over his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?<br>
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]<br>
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.<br>
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!<br>
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]<br>
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ooh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, uh, patties. [chuckles]<br>
SpongeBob: I how do that?<br>
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... um... I'm gonna help ya.<br>
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs sitting on the floor in SpongeBob's living room.]<br>
Mr. Krabs: If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]<br>
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...<br>
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]<br>
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!<br>
Mr. Krabs: It is?<br>
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that [angry] I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!<br>
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that.<br>
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate!? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [realizes that he just put the patty together in the right order, which makes Mr. Krabs smirk]<br>
Mr. Krabs: It's time.<br>
[The scene cuts to the interior of the Krusty Krab, with black smoke continuing to spread from the kitchen. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back there. SpongeBob rescues a burnt Squidward from the kitchen and sprays him with the fire extinguisher]<br>
Incidental 70: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [customers are cheering]<br>
Customers: SpongeBob? Aw, the old chef.<br>
Bubble Bass: [he enters the restaurant, shoving the large crowd of people out of his way in the process] I hear SquarePants is back. [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]<br>
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.<br>
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]<br>
SpongeBob: This is where I belong. [holds up some bubbles and blows one. Bubble Bass gives a weird sounding roar] Rawr.<br>
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation.]<br>
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular, and this time, don't forget the pickles.<br>
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I did it.<br>
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty. It also cuts to the crowd, then Squidward, then SpongeBob.]<br>
Bubble Bass: Hmm... Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is disgusted at the sight of it] You failed again, SpongeBob LoserPants! [laughs]<br>
SpongeBob: [looks at Bubble Bass' mouth] Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!<br>
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!<br>
Incidental 45: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]<br>
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [rushes out of the Krusty Krab]<br>
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...<br>
All: Hooray!<br>
Squidward: Hooray.<br>
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...<br>
All: Hooray!<br>
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.<br>
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...<br>
All: Hooray!<br>
Squidward: Oh, boy.<br>
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...<br>
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]<br>
SpongeBob: Hip hip...<br>
All: Boo! [cuts to an outside shot of the Krusty Krab]<br>
SpongeBob: Hip hip...<br>
All: Boo!<br>
SpongeBob: Hip hip...<br>
Customer: Boo! You stink! The episode ends.<br>
